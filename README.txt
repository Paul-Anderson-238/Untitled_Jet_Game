This untitled game was created for STEM outreach of Hill AFB by 
Paul Anderson. I have no copyright to any of the code and I don't 
care what you do with this code if you get your hands on it. Alter 
and use this code to your hearts content. In other words, have fun. :)

Possible Improvements:
 *  There are a few explosion frames for an explosion in
	the game loop. Better/more frames could be added to make the 
	explosion smoother.
 *  levels/filepaths can be exported to an external source. 
	Currently, if you were to add another
	difficulty level, changes would need to be made in almost all files.
	If the definitions were moved to an external source, it would be 
	trivial to add more difficulty features.
 *  New background images/levels/obstacles can be added. I personally
	think that a desert background could be cool. I would adjust it so
	that only bottom points were added to create dunes and mesas. 
	Additionally, I would add flying obstacles. It would be a bit of 
	work but doable and definitely cool. Do what you think is coolest.
 *  Currently, there are no Sound Effects at all. There is plenty of
	room for Sound Effects to be added.
 *  Code base could adjusted to more strictly adhere to state machine 
	design. It is somewhat okay as is but the menu should be its own
	state. In the current design the menu is it's own state and the 
	state machine.
